Odoo on kubernetes
---

NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT MEANT FOR RUNNING IN PRODUCTION. IT'S A SHOWCASE SETUP 
FOR RUNNING A SIMPLE APPLICATION ATOP KUBERNETES. IF YOU WAN TO USE A 
PRODUCTION ODOO SETUP, USE 
[THE STABLE HELM CHART](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/odoo).
WHICH FEATURES A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF CONFIGURING AND RUNNING ODOO.

This repository is a showcase deployment of Odoo on a Kubernetes cluster using
[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).  
See [repo instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation) for
setting up minikube.  
First of all see what [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) is.  

##### Standalone example
If you're running a standalone example of kubernetes in `dev` mode (all-in-one),
use the example provided in [standalone/odoo.yaml](./standalone). This example uses a
different [odoo docker image](https://github.com/cloudflavor/odoo-docker) that
fixes an environment variable which makes the database service discoverable
without the dns addon.  
If you are running the dns addon, then the example in `minikube/` should work
out of the box.  

##### Epehmeral
If you're not interested in persistent data at all, and just want to deploy an
example, you can use the [ephemeral example](./ephemeral).


#### Minikube
Download a [release of
minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases).  

```
minikube start

Starting local Kubernetes cluster...
```

Create the Kubernetes `service`, `pv`, `pvc` for both odoo and the postgres db
with the `odoo.yaml` file. This will also create a namespace for `odoo`.
```
kubectl apply -f minikube/odoo.yaml

service "odoo-db" created
deployment "odoo-db" created
service "odoo-shop" created
deployment "odoo-shop" created
```

Wait for the pods to start before accessing the application.  
```
kubectl get po

NAME                         READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
odoo-db-3075219300-nx0kw     0/1       ContainerCreating   0          3s
odoo-shop-2676823603-s46lz   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          3s
```

```
kubectl get po

NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
odoo-db-3075219300-nx0kw     1/1       Running   0          1m
odoo-shop-2676823603-s46lz   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

When the pods are ready, you can access the frontend service in the browser.  
```
minikube service odoo-shop

Opening kubernetes service default/odoo-shop in default browser...
```
###### NOTE:

When accessing the service the first time, Odoo starts creating its static files
and tries to connect to the database. This might take a while, to see the
progress you can tail the logs of the pod. Replace `odoo-shop-2676823603-s46lz`
with the container name returned by `kubectl get po` for `odoo-shop` to see the
initialization progress.

```
kubectl logs -f odoo-shop-2676823603-s46lz
```


The browser will open with the following page, fill in the details for test data
and remember to check `Load demonstration data`.  

![administrator](assets/odoo_admin.png)

`Install` eCommerce (third app down from the right).

![apps](assets/odoo_apps.png)

Give it a while to load all assets... When prompted, select your theme style.
(either `bootswatch` or `plain bootstrap`)  

![themes](assets/odoo_theme.png)


And now you can start hacking on your e-shop!

#### Persistent data
Your changes and data persist between restarts. `minikube stop && minikube
start`. This is because the PVs are mounted in `/data` which is a folder that
[minikube keeps](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/persistent_volumes/). If
you want to eliminate them you have to do `minikube delete` and start your
cluster back up.
